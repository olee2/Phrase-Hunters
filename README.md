Phrase Hunters

This is an exercise in object-oriented programming using Python. 
 
This is a game where the users guess the characters in a phrase. They have 5 lives, losing one for each wrong guess. The phrase should be randomly chosen from a list of at least five phrases. Before each character has been guessed correctly an underscore will be displayed in its place. Spaces should be displayed at all times, to show the separation of words. 

Every character in the phrase is converted to an instance of the character class. The actual phrase that the user is trying to guess is an instance of the Phrase class holding a list of all instances of the Character class.
